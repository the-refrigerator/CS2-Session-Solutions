## Online

There are several good online C compilers you can choose from:
* [GDB compiler](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c_compiler)
* [One compiler](https://onecompiler.com/c/) (doesn't allow for direct input from terminal but instead uses `STDIN` located on the right for user input instead)
* [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/online-compiler/) (has some issues with user input, wouldn't recommend)

## Offline

You'd need to download the repository on your device.
